Hello, World!

These files contain my answers to the assignment for Applying SQL in Python, Module 5 Lesson 3.

1. Gym Database Management with Python and SQL
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to reinforce your understanding of Python's interaction with SQL databases, focusing on 
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the context of a gym's membership and workout session management system. You will 
work with two tables: 'Members' and 'WorkoutSessions'.

Problem Statement: You are tasked with developing a Python application to manage a gym's database. The database consists of 'Members' 
and 'WorkoutSessions' tables. Your role is to implement various functions to add, retrieve, update, and delete records in these tables, 
ensuring data integrity and efficient data handling.

The file named 'gym_database_management.py' contains the code that runs each of the 4 functions created for the tasks to be completed.

Task 1 is completed in the file named 'add_gym_member.py'
Task 2 is completed in the file named 'add_workout_session.py'
Task 3 is completed in the file named 'update_member_age.py'
Task 4 is completed in the file named 'delete_workout.py'

2. Advanced Data Analysis in Gym Management System
Objective: The goal of this assignment is to advance your SQL querying skills within Python, focusing on specific SQL functions and clauses like BETWEEN. You will be working with the same gym database as in the previous assignment, comprising the Members and WorkoutSessions tables.

Problem Statement: As a part of the gym's management team, you need to conduct an in-depth analysis of the membership data. Your task is to develop Python functions that execute advanced SQL queries for distinct department identification, employee count in each department, and age-based employee filtering.

Task 1 is completed in the file named 'advanced_data_analysis.py'

The file named 'database_connection.py' contains the code to connect to the Fitness Center Database.
